MarkerClusterer-BackgroundSize-Support
======================================

I took the MarkerClusterer plugin for Google Maps (http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/docs/reference.html) and enchanced its styling possibilities by adding support for the backgroundSize property (in case you want to use retina images).
